# Coaches making changes to the book *in_progress*

To develop the book locally, you first need to set up a Python environment with
all the packages used to build the book. Edit the book by editing the
Jupyter notebooks in the `content/` folder. To publish changes to the live
book, make a pull request on GitHub. This file will contain instructions for all of
these steps.

## Python environment setup

Follow these steps to set up the textbook locally. You only have to go through
these steps once per machine.
